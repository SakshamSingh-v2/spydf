# spydf
## Automatically convert your screenshots into PDF using Python!

### Description
Habbit of taking numerous screenshots while doing something and never opening them again? Well yeah, screenshots folder is hell of a mess.

Presenting **SPYDF**,
a python program which will automatically create a pdf of your captured screenshots so you don't have to manage them again and again.

I have created **two versions** of this Program
* Spydf
* Spydf_cli
_(pretty self explanatory, right?)_

### Instructions to use

1. Clone this repo
2. Go to spydf folder (**important**: all files are necessary for the program to run)
3. Either run **spydf.pyw** normally or **spydf_cli.py** through interpreter.
4. On first run, program will ask for the path to screenshots folder of your OS (*you know it, right?*)

#### GUI Screens
